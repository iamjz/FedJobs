# FedJobs

Text analytics on federal job postings. In this repo, you'll find:

- Data Scraper (API_Caller.ipynb): This notebook scrapes current federal job listings from https://www.usajobs.gov

- Job Postings (collected_data): This folder contains all the scraped job postings. I've kept them in there for ease of analysis

- Job Recommendations (TFIDF_SimilarJobs.ipynb): This notebook takes in your resume (in .txt format) and finds the top 10 job listings that match your skillset. 

- List of Resumes (resumes): This folder contains my input resume. It's an old outdated resume so if you want to creep, just check out my linkedin profile instead: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhaojacky/

## Work in progress

- Analysis of job postings in different demographics
