BASIC REQUIREMENT(S):
1) Degree: Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy from a school in the United States or Canada approved by a recognized accredit body in the year of the applicant's graduation. A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed pre medical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country.2) Graduate Training: Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.

Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and sub specialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-14, 4 years of residency training in Obstetrics-Gynecology or have equivalent Obstetrics-Gynecology specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-15, 5 years of residency training in Obstetrics-Gynecology or have equivalent Obstetrics-Gynecology specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as psychiatrists and surgeons must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties. An exception may be made when a peer panel of physicians (subject-matter experts) determines and documents that the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired in professional medical practice are equivalent to those acquired during the same period of time in a graduate training program.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/464159200

for appointment as a psychologist in VHA, there is no distinction between the
specialty areas (with the exception of school psychology). OR (2) Have a doctoral degree in any

acceptable in fulfillment of the internship requirement, provided that such
programs were sanctioned by the VHA Central Office Program Director for
Psychology and the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations at the time that the
individual was an intern; OR (c) VHA facilities that offered
full-time, one-year pre-doctoral internships prior to PL 96-151 (pre-1979) are

internship that was not accredited by APA or CPA at the time the program was
completed may be considered eligible for hire only
if they are currently board
certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology in a specialty area

employed. (NOTE: Once board certified, the employee is required to maintain
board certification.) Licensure Hold
a full, current, and unrestricted license to practice psychology at the
doctoral level in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States, or
the District of Columbia. Loss of

For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board&#39;s eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test - Evidence of having successfully passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination, or any other written test required for professional registration, by an engineering licensure board in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. 3.
