You may be (1) required to hike into unusually rugged areas to inspect abandoned sites; (2) subject to call 24 hours a day; and (3) required to work long non-stop tours-of-duty, occasionally in excess of thirty hours. Some work is sedentary, although much of the job requires overnight field trips which involve physical activity on irregular terrains and work at physically demanding job sites. Office work consists predominantly of working at a desk and using a computer, including using a mobile device to record measurements.Work Environment: Much of the work is at field locations where it is necessary to wear appropriate safety equipment. You must walk under and around heavy derrick and hoisting equipment and piping and around other potentially hazardous operating equipment. Work environment involves exposure to extreme weather conditions, hostile flora and fauna, hazardous explosive fumes, poisonous gasses, toxic chemicals, high frequency noises, high-pressure and high temperature equipment, detonating devices, and moving machinery. Work involves climbing up and down ladders and steep stairways. A large part of the time is spent driving to work sites that are located in isolated areas. This work environment requires the use of hard hats, hard-toe boots, safety glasses, ear protection equipment, poisonous gas detection equipment, and cold weather gear and/or a respirator may also be required.
