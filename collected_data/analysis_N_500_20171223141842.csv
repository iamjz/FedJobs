Information about an individual&#39;s employment experience will be used only to determine the person&#39;s qualifications and to assess his or her relative level of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Although an individual&#39;s personal conduct may be relevant in any employment decision, including conduct during periods of unemployment or evidence of dishonesty in handling financial matters, financial difficulty that has arisen through no fault of the individual will generally not itself be the basis of an unfavorable suitability or fitness determination. i.

ONLY""INDIVIDUAL OCCUPATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: BASIC REQUIREMENTS: DEGREE: Major study
in an academic field related to the health sciences or allied sciences
appropriate to the work of the position.BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL GRADES: Applicants who meet the basic requirements
described in the individual occupational requirements listed above are fully
qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who
wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and
above) must also meet the requirements for educations and specialized
experience listed below, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.The individual occupational requirements
typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic
requirements of the occupations covered by this standard: 1.
Successful
completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or
university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field
of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in the individual
occupational requirements (IOR). Where
specific course requirements are not indicated in the IOR Requirements, the
number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the
amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot
be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major
field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have
been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the
field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses
that may be accepted as part of the program major. 2.
Appropriate
combination of education and experience that is typically specified in the
individual occupational requirements (IOR). The method generally requires that
an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in the IOR
for the applicable degree field, plus additional education and/or experience.
The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a
major field of study is the same as described in the IOR. The
quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to
demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities
required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally
acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study
with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and
related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that
involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses
would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to
perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore,
creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or
abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation. In addition
to the basic requirements for employment, the following specific grade criteria
must be met at each grade level in which you are applying. EDUCATION AND SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: GS-09: Specialized
Experience: Applicants must have one
(1) year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade,
GS-07, in the normal line of progression for the occupation in the

proposals and materials supporting grant application; screens and evaluates
candidates for clinical research studies and projects of limited complexity
using objective rating techniques to identify potential candidates for
participation in studies; manages implementation, control and reporting on
clinical and outcome of research tests and administers standard test to measure
and track indicators; etc. (NOTE:
SF-50 ""Notification of Personnel Action"" showing series, grade, and
step of current position. Do not submit an ""Award or Incentive""
SF-50 as it cannot be used to qualify for this position. REQUIRED) Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including
volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps,
AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic;
religions; spiritual; community; student; social). Volunteer work helps build critical
competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and
experience that translates directly to paid employment. You will receive credit for all qualifying
experience, including volunteer experience. OR Education: MUST have two (2) full years of progressively
higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree or master's or
equivalent graduate degree? Completion
of graduate level education, in addition to meeting the basic requirement, is
qualifying at grades GS-07 through GS-11, and GS-12 research positions if it
provides the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work. One (1) year of full-time graduate education
is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has
determined to represent one (1) year of graduate study. Part-time graduate education is creditable in
accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school
attended. PLEASE SUBMIT A COPY OF UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS WITH YOUR
APPLICATION, IF USING EDUCATION TO QUALIFY. (REQUIRED) OR Combination of Education and
Experience: Do you possess a
combination of successfully completed graduate level and specialized experience
required for the grade level for which you are applying for? Only graduate

Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. In addition to meeting the basic requirement above, to qualify for this position you must also meet the qualification requirements listed below: GS-13 Specialized Experience: One year of specialized experience which includes: independently performing analysis and developing designs for geotechnical features of large and small projects such as deep foundations, shallow foundations, slope stability, seepage, instrumentation, etc.; leading project teams in the development of plans, design specifications, and geotechnical studies for large or a combination of smaller engineering projects; planning and performing complex geotechnical site evaluations, subsurface/geotechnical investigations and testing programs; preparing detailed reports, technical papers, drawings and specifications pertaining to geotechnical engineering; AND managing a multi-discipline team while maintaining scope, schedule and budget on several different projects of varying complexity simultaneously. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-12).
