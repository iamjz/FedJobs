To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate&#39;s degree. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-05, students must have completed 4 academic years of post-high school leading to a bachelor&#39;s degree or equivalent degree. NOTE: Students that are graduating and are not subsequently enrolled in another program might not meet the work-hour requirements prior to graduation and will be at risk for not being able to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment! For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools&#39; definition of ""academic year"" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year). Absent this documentation, you will screened for academic qualifications based on the academic hours as defined in the bullets above.

in an academic field related to the health sciences or allied sciences
appropriate to the work of the position.BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL GRADES: Applicants who meet the basic requirements
described in the individual occupational requirements listed above are fully
qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who
wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and
above) must also meet the requirements for educations and specialized
experience listed below, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.The individual occupational requirements
typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic
requirements of the occupations covered by this standard: 1.
Successful
completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or
university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field
of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in the individual
occupational requirements (IOR). Where
specific course requirements are not indicated in the IOR Requirements, the
number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the
amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot
be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major
field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have
been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the
field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses
that may be accepted as part of the program major. 2.
Appropriate
combination of education and experience that is typically specified in the
individual occupational requirements (IOR). The method generally requires that
an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in the IOR
for the applicable degree field, plus additional education and/or experience.
The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a
major field of study is the same as described in the IOR. The
quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to
demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities
required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally
acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study
with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and
related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that
involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses
would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to
perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore,
creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or
abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation. In addition
to the basic requirements for employment, the following specific grade criteria
must be met at each grade level in which you are applying. EDUCATION AND SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: GS-09: Specialized
Experience: Applicants must have one
(1) year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade,
GS-07, in the normal line of progression for the occupation in the
