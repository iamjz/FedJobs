The level of practice for this position fully meets Type II criteria.

Frequently issues have conflicting intent, ambiguous or absent guidance between Federal and state/territory, state/territory and state/territory, state/territory and local, DoD Component (Departments of Army and Air Force, or ARNG and ANG), and other agencies (Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency), and/or Federal or state/territory executive branch issuances, etc. The incumbent functions as an expert, advising and acting across the full spectrum law concerns, including the highly conflicted and emotionally charged areas of trial or trial defense, equal opportunity and labor law provisions, processes and third party reviews, as well as personnel administrative actions.

He/she serves as the Adjutant General&#39;s representative on personnel administration and labor issues, i.e. employee grievances, disciplinary &amp; adverse actions, discrimination complaints, unfair labor practices and labor contract negotiations. Cases that arise require preparation for third party resolution or appellate review by arbitrators, administrative law judges, the Merit System Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission processes. Issues generally are strongly contested in either informal negotiations or formal hearings by the individuals, management representatives or unions representatives involved and have decisions with impact for wide application across organizations and potentially agency wide. The incumbent addresses legal issues that encompass environmental concerns associated with Federal and state/territory statutes; implementing regulations and directives; executive orders; and agency directives. These laws include, but are not limited to, air quality; water quality; wetlands and wildlife habitat; solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal; recreational uses of land; and historic preservations.

Advice rendered or resolutions sought directly or indirectly on contractual obligations involve large sums of money. While it is common to advise on, negotiate or review contracts for ""very large sums of money"", involved with military construction projects, environmental projects and cleanup, and subsequent cooperative or inter-service support agreements, it is less common for those ""very large sums of money"" to ""contested"", but those situations do exist. More common is the competition among individuals and companies for these contracting opportunities, and thus contract awards challenges as well as increasing willingness to formally challenge the means and methods to achieve contract specifications, thus delaying and adding additional administrative and inflationary costs to already expensive projects. These costs can, and do, soar achieving ""large"", and in some cases ""very large"", sums of money when the costs associated with the delays, studies and alternative processes are complied.
