There&#39;s something about Asheville, located in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina that makes its blend of remote Appalachian charm and cosmopolitan sophistication seem perfectly natural. The city abounds in cultural attractions and events, many stemming from the literary greats who have lived here. Thomas Wolfe, Carl Sandburg and O. Henry all once called Asheville home. The area&#39;s spectacular beauty led millionaire George W. Vanderbilt to locate Biltmore, his castle-like mansion, in Asheville, and the city has historically been a resort for the wealthy. But there&#39;s also a friendly, small-town atmosphere; the city has a way of making visitors feel right at home. Located at the confluence of two rivers and nestled in the mountains, Asheville is a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts, who have their pick of hiking, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, hot air ballooning and many other activities. Architecture buffs can study the Art Deco City Hall, turn-of-the-century houses and Tudor-style homes. So breathe in the fresh mountain air, take a spin along ""America&#39;s most scenic drive,"" the Blue Ridge Parkway, and soak up the beauty and spirit of this lovely mountain city.
