GS-12: Specialized Experience: One year of specialized experience which includes 1) Experience supervising or leading a project team in the application of industrial engineering theories, practices, techniques and/ or procedures to improve functional layouts of facilities; 2) Experience in the application of capacity and capability analysis to improve efficiency within production organizations; 3) Experience with supervising or leading a team with identifying workflow requirements and implementing change to optimize process flows; 4) Experience conducting post investment analysis; 5) Experience in supervising or leading a team in program/project management with the use of Project Planning software such as Microsoft Project; AND 6) Experience developing blueprints/layouts utilizing computer aid design software such as AutoCAD. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-11 or above). You will be evaluated on the basis of your level of competency in the following areas:

Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than a written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State board&#39;s eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would not be rated eligible for biomedical engineering positions. 2. Written Test: Evidence of having successfully passed the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) examination, or the written test required for professional registration, which is administered by the Boards of Engineering Examiners of a State, Territory, Commonwealth of the United States (e.g., Puerto Rico), or the District of Columbia.

Eligibility is limited to positions that are within, or closely related to, the specialty field of the engineering technology program. Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development, or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science must meet the basic requirements in paragraph 2.b.(1). Because of the diversity in kind and quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of the possession of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be demonstrated by passing the EIT examination. 3. Specified academic courses: Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in paragraph 2.b(1). 4. Related curriculum.
