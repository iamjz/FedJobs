There&#39;s something about Asheville, located in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina that makes its blend of remote Appalachian charm and cosmopolitan sophistication seem perfectly natural. The city abounds in cultural attractions and events, many stemming from the literary greats who have lived here. Thomas Wolfe, Carl Sandburg and O. Henry all once called Asheville home. The area&#39;s spectacular beauty led millionaire George W. Vanderbilt to locate Biltmore, his castle-like mansion, in Asheville, and the city has historically been a resort for the wealthy. But there&#39;s also a friendly, small-town atmosphere; the city has a way of making visitors feel right at home. Located at the confluence of two rivers and nestled in the mountains, Asheville is a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts, who have their pick of hiking, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, hot air ballooning and many other activities. Architecture buffs can study the Art Deco City Hall, turn-of-the-century houses and Tudor-style homes. So breathe in the fresh mountain air, take a spin along ""America&#39;s most scenic drive,"" the Blue Ridge Parkway, and soak up the beauty and spirit of this lovely mountain city.

For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.

These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-15: 5 years of residency training in Anesthesiology or have equivalent Anesthesiology specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSTITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as anesthesiology must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties. An exception may be made when a peer panel of physicians (subject-matter experts) determines and documents that the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired in professional medical practice are equivalent to those acquired during the same period of time in a graduate training program.MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:Your resume must demonstrate at least one year of specialized experience at or equivalent to at least the next lower grade level in the Federal service obtained in either the private or public sector.
