The court was formed by the merger of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims. The court is located in the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building on historic Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. The Federal Circuit is unique among the thirteen Circuit Courts of Appeal. It has nationwide jurisdiction in a variety of subject areas, including international trade, government contracts, patents, trademarks, certain money claims against the United States government, federal personnel, veterans&#39; benefits, and public safety officers&#39; benefits claims. Appeals to the court come from all federal district courts, the United States Court of Federal Claims, the United States Court of International Trade, and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. The court also takes appeals of certain administrative agencies&#39; decisions, including the United States Merit Systems Protection Board, the Boards of Contract Appeals, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Decisions of the United States International Trade Commission, the Office of Compliance, an independent agency in the legislative branch, the Government Accountability Office Personnel Appeals Board, and the Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance also are reviewed by the court. The Systems Network Engineer position is located in the Information Technology Office (ITO) and reports directly to the Information Technology Project Manager. The incumbent is responsible for providing expert technical support for the court&#39;s Cisco voice, network, and data telecommunications systems, to include customer support, design and development, procurement, installation and implementation, testing and security.
