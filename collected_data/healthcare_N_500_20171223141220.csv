[A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) (or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed premedical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country).]In addition, to the Basic Requirements, you must also meet the Minimum Qualifications stated below-MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:Graduate Training:Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training.Licensure: For positions involving patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States.

If the agency does not waive the license requirement for these kinds of positions, candidates may be appointed subject to obtaining a license within 1 year.Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board). Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license.Applicants who meet the basic requirements qualify for GS-11 positions.Additional Requirements for Grades GS-12 and Above:The requirements below are grouped according to types of programs-clinical and training, aviation medical, occupational health, disability evaluation, maternal and child health, and research.Clinical and Training Programs- Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. General practitioners must be skilled in recognizing various medical pathologies that require referral to specialists for diagnostic and treatment procedures. Graduate training and experience must, therefore, be well rounded. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled. Experience may not be substituted for training essential for performing specialized duties. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.Specialist positions For GS-14 -- 4 years of residency training in the specialty of the position to be filled or equivalent experience and training.

For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics).

for employment as a VHA psychologist are prescribed by: Public Law 96-151

for the position of psychologist in VHA must meet the following: Citizenship. Citizen of the United States. Education. Have a doctoral degree in psychology from a graduate program in psychology
accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), the Psychological
Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS), or the Canadian Psychological

the degree must be consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to
be employed. For the purpose of meeting this requirement, the term
""specialty area"" refers to the specific specialty areas recognized by
the accrediting body and not to specific job duties that might require special
skills. Currently, APA accredits doctoral programs in the specialty areas of
clinical psychology, counseling psychology, school psychology, or combinations
of two or more of those areas. PCSAS accredits doctoral programs in
psychological clinical science. CPA accredits doctoral programs in clinical
psychology, counseling psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and school
psychology. There are no job assignments in VHA that require the skills of a
school psychologist; therefore, an applicant with a degree in the specialty
area of school psychology is not eligible for appointment. Strictly for the
purpose of determining eligibility for appointment as a psychologist in VHA,
there is no distinction between the specialty areas (with the exception of
school psychology). OR (2) Have a doctoral degree in any area of psychology and, in addition,
successfully complete a respecialization program (including documentation of an

accredited doctoral program; and (b) the specialty in which the applicant is retrained must be consistent with
the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. NOTE: The applicant must provide an official transcript and/or
certificate documenting the completion of the respecialization program, which
includes completion of an APA or CPA internship. AND (3) Internships (a) Have successfully completed a professional psychology internship training
program that was accredited by APA or CPA at the time the program was completed
and that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be
employed. OR (b) New VHA psychology internship programs that are in the process of applying
for APA accreditation are acceptable in fulfillment of the internship
requirement, provided that such programs were sanctioned by the VHA Central
Office Program Director for Psychology and the VHA Office of Academic
Affiliations at the time that the individual was an intern; OR (c) VHA facilities that offered full-time, one-year pre-doctoral internships
prior to PL 96-151 (pre-1979) are considered to be acceptable in fulfillment of
the internship requirement; OR (d) Applicants who completed an internship that was not accredited by APA or
CPA at the time the program was completed may be considered eligible for hire
only if they are currently board certified by the American Board of
Professional Psychology in a specialty area that is consistent with the
assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. (NOTE: Once board
certified, the employee is required to maintain board certification.) Licensure. Hold a full, current, and unrestricted license to practice psychology at
the doctoral level in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States,
