Observe all workplace rules To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-03, students must have completed one full academic year of post-high school study. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-04, students must have completed two full academic years of post-high school study or have an associate&#39;s degree. To qualify for a Pathways Internship as a GS-05, students must have completed 4 academic years of post-high school leading to a bachelor&#39;s degree or equivalent degree. NOTE: Students that are graduating and are not subsequently enrolled in another program might not meet the work-hour requirements prior to graduation and will be at risk for not being able to convert to a career or career-conditional appointment! For qualification purposes, an academic year is computed as follows: At the undergraduate level, successfully completed education that has not led to possession of a degree is credited based on its relationship to 120 semester hours or 180 quarter hours. For example, 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours is comparable to 1 year of undergraduate education. Four years of progressive study or 120 semester hours meets the degree requirements. Additional credit cannot be given for duplicate course work. For study at a business or technical school, 36 weeks of study (20+ classroom hours per week) is comparable to 1 academic year above high school. An academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has determined to represent 1 academic year of full-time study. This determination is made based on normal course loads for a full year of study in the graduate program. If that information cannot be obtained from the school, 18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours should be considered as satisfying the 1 year of full-time study requirement. Part-time graduate education is creditable in accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school attended. When academic credit is expressed in contract months, units, or other terms that differ from conventional semester or quarter hours, it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide an interpretation of such credits from the appropriate institution in order to equate them to the semester or quarter hours specified in the standard. NOTE: If your college, vocational, trade, technical or high schools&#39; definition of ""academic year"" differs from above, you must submit proof of this difference (e.g., copy of course catalog that defines an academic year). Absent this documentation, you will screened for academic qualifications based on the academic hours as defined in the bullets above.
