effective date of this qualification standard are considered to have met all
qualification requirements for the title, series and grade held, including
positive education and certification that are part of the basic requirements of

provisions apply: (1) DRTs that require a certification, may be
reassigned, promoted up to and including the full performance (journeyman)
level, or changed to lower grade within the occupation, but may not be promoted
beyond the journey level or placed in supervisory or managerial positions. (2) DRTs that require a certification only at
higher grade levels must meet the certification requirement before they can be
promoted to those higher grade levels. (3) DRTs who are appointed on a temporary basis
prior to the effective date of the qualification standard may not have their
temporary appointment extended or be reappointed, on a temporary or permanent
basis, until they fully meet the basic requirements of the standard. (4) DRTs initially grandfathered into this

Each uncertified VHA DRT who was
permanently employed on June 21, 1986, and whose competence in the safe
