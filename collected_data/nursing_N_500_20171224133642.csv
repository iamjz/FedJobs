The five Core Values define ""who we are"", our culture, and how we care for our Veterans, their families and other beneficiaries. The values are Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence (""I Care""). Patient-centered care is our approach to delivering healthcare to our Veterans. This philosophy gives parents and their families the chance to work closely with their healthcare providers to create more personalized care plans. Patient-centered care also considers the Veterans&#39; personal preference and values, family situations, cultural traditions, and lifestyles; it keeps them informed and engaged throughout their treatment.
