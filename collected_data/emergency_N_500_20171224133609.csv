BASIC REQUIREMENT(S):
1) Degree: Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy from a school in the United States or Canada approved by a recognized accrediting body in the year of the applicant's graduation. A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed premedical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country.2) Graduate Training: Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.

Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license. In addition to the BASIC REQUIREMENTS listed above, you must also meet the ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for positions at the GS-15 or above:Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-15, 5 years of residency training in Emergency Medicine or have equivalent Emergency Medicine specialist experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as psychiatrists and surgeons must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties. An exception may be made when a peer panel of physicians (subject-matter experts) determines and documents that the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired in professional medical practice are equivalent to those acquired during the same period of time in a graduate training program.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/464159700

(This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training.Licensure: For positions involving patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States.

PCSAS accredits doctoral programs in psychological clinical science. CPA accredits doctoral programs in clinical psychology, counseling psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and school psychology. There are no job assignments in VHA that require the skills of a school psychologist; therefore, an applicant with a degree in the specialty area of school psychology is not eligible for appointment.

OR (b) New VHA psychology internship programs that are in the process of applying for APA accreditation are acceptable in fulfillment of the internship requirement, provided that such programs were sanctioned by the VHA Central Office Program Director for Psychology and the VHA Office of Academic Affiliations at the time that the individual was an intern; OR (c) VHA facilities that offered full-time, one-year pre-doctoral internships prior to PL 96-151 (pre-1979) are considered to be acceptable in fulfillment of the internship requirement; OR (d) Applicants who completed an internship that was not accredited by APA or CPA at the time the program was completed may be considered eligible for hire only if they are currently board certified by the American Board of Professional Psychology in a specialty area that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:
Graduate Training:Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training.Licensure: For positions involving patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States.

If the agency does not waive the license requirement for these kinds of positions, candidates may be appointed subject to obtaining a license within 1 year.Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board).

Graduate training and experience must, therefore, be well rounded. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled.

Frequently issues have conflicting intent, ambiguous or absent guidance between Federal and state/territory, state/territory and state/territory, state/territory and local, DoD Component (Departments of Army and Air Force, or ARNG and ANG), and other agencies (Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency), and/or Federal or state/territory executive branch issuances, etc. The incumbent functions as an expert, advising and acting across the full spectrum law concerns, including the highly conflicted and emotionally charged areas of trial or trial defense, equal opportunity and labor law provisions, processes and third party reviews, as well as personnel administrative actions.

He/she serves as the Adjutant General&#39;s representative on personnel administration and labor issues, i.e. employee grievances, disciplinary &amp; adverse actions, discrimination complaints, unfair labor practices and labor contract negotiations. Cases that arise require preparation for third party resolution or appellate review by arbitrators, administrative law judges, the Merit System Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission processes. Issues generally are strongly contested in either informal negotiations or formal hearings by the individuals, management representatives or unions representatives involved and have decisions with impact for wide application across organizations and potentially agency wide. The incumbent addresses legal issues that encompass environmental concerns associated with Federal and state/territory statutes; implementing regulations and directives; executive orders; and agency directives.

Advice rendered or resolutions sought directly or indirectly on contractual obligations involve large sums of money. While it is common to advise on, negotiate or review contracts for ""very large sums of money"", involved with military construction projects, environmental projects and cleanup, and subsequent cooperative or inter-service support agreements, it is less common for those ""very large sums of money"" to ""contested"", but those situations do exist. More common is the competition among individuals and companies for these contracting opportunities, and thus contract awards challenges as well as increasing willingness to formally challenge the means and methods to achieve contract specifications, thus delaying and adding additional administrative and inflationary costs to already expensive projects. These costs can, and do, soar achieving ""large"", and in some cases ""very large"", sums of money when the costs associated with the delays, studies and alternative processes are complied.
