To be acceptable, the curriculum must: (1) be in a school of engineering with at least one curriculum accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as a professional engineering curriculum; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics. For the Hydrology position, you must posses at least a bachelor&#39;s degree in physical or natural science, or engineering. To be acceptable, the curriculum must: be a bachelor&#39;s degree (or higher degree) in physical or natural science, or engineering that included at least 30 semester hours in any combination of courses in hydrology, the physical sciences, geophysics, chemistry, engineering science, soils, mathematics, aquatic biology, atmospheric science, meteorology, geology, oceanography, or the management or conservation of water resources. Course work must include at least 6 semester hours in calculus (including both differential and integral calculus), and at least 6 semester hours in physics. Specialized Experience for the GS-07: One year of specialized experience which includes performing engineering work such as performing engineering or hydrology work such as searching technical reports to obtain information relating to projects; and applying basic formulas to routine calculations. This definition of specialized experience is typical of work performed at the second lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-05).
