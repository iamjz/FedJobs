Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Director of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).
A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.

Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and sub specialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-14, 4 years of residency training in Obstetrics-Gynecology or have equivalent Obstetrics-Gynecology specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-15, 5 years of residency training in Obstetrics-Gynecology or have equivalent Obstetrics-Gynecology specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties.

BASIC REQUIREMENT(S):
1) Degree: Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy from a school in the United States or Canada approved by a recognized accrediting body in the year of the applicant's graduation. A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed premedical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country.2) Graduate Training: Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training.

For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.

Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.

In addition, to the Basic Requirements, you must also meet the Minimum Qualifications stated below-
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:
Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-13, 3 years of residency training in Emergency Medicine or have equivalent Emergency Medicine specialist experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-14, 4 years of residency training in Emergency Medicine or have equivalent Emergency Medicine specialist experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-15, 5 years of residency training in Emergency Medicine or have equivalent Emergency Medicine specialist experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as psychiatrists and surgeons must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties.

BASIC REQUIREMENT(S):
You must meet all of the BASIC REQUIREMENTS listed below:1) Degree: Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy from a school in the United States or Canada approved by a recognized accrediting body in the year of the applicant's graduation. A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed pre medical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country.2) Graduate Training: Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA. A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training. 3) Licensure: For positions involved with direct patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States. Applications will be accepted from physicians who are not currently licensed; however, if selected for a Federal appointment, they must (a) obtain a license before entering on duty, or (b) meet the following provisions: Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board). Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license. In addition to the BASIC REQUIREMENTS listed above, you must also meet the ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for positions at the GS-13 or above:Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and sub specialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-13, 3 years of residency training in Primary Care specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine, Family Practice, or Pediatric Medicine) or have equivalent Primary Care specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-14, 4 years of residency training in Primary Care specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine, Family Practice, or Pediatric Medicine) or have equivalent Primary Care specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-15, 5 years of residency training in a Primary Care specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine, Family Practice, or Pediatric Medicine) or have equivalent Primary Care specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as psychiatrists and surgeons must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties. An exception may be made when a peer panel of physicians (subject-matter experts) determines and documents that the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired in professional medical practice are equivalent to those acquired during the same period of time in a graduate training program.The selected individual is required to obtain and maintain medical staff clinical privileges, including any licensure requirements. If privileges are not obtained or maintained during employment, the employee will be subject to adverse actions, up to and including removal from Federal service.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/464157800

BASIC REQUIREMENT(S):
1) Degree: Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy from a school in the United States or Canada approved by a recognized accrediting body in the year of the applicant's graduation. A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed pre medical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country.2) Graduate Training: Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians. An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA. A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training. 3) Licensure: For positions involved with direct patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States. Applications will be accepted from physicians who are not currently licensed; however, if selected for a Federal appointment, they must (a) obtain a license before entering on duty, or (b) meet the following provisions: Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board). Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license. In addition to the BASIC REQUIREMENTS listed above, you must also meet the ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for positions at the GS-13 or above:Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and sub specialty of the position to be filled. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.For GS-13, 3 years of residency training in Primary Care specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine, Family Practice, or Pediatric Medicine) or have equivalent Primary Care specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.For GS-14, 4 years of residency training in Primary Care specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine, Family Practice, or Pediatric Medicine) or have equivalent Primary Care specialized experience and training that demonstrates the ability to provide independent patient care.Substitution of Experience for Residency Training: Experience MAY NOT BE SUBSITUTED for residency training that is essential for the performance of specialized duties. For example, specialists such as psychiatrists and surgeons must complete the number of years of accredited residency training required in their respective specialties. An exception may be made when a peer panel of physicians (subject-matter experts) determines and documents that the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired in professional medical practice are equivalent to those acquired during the same period of time in a graduate training program.The selected individual is required to obtain and maintain medical staff clinical privileges, including any licensure requirements. If privileges are not obtained or maintained during employment, the employee will be subject to adverse actions, up to and including removal from Federal service.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/464157200

[A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) (or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed premedical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country).]In addition, to the Basic Requirements, you must also meet the Minimum Qualifications stated below-
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:
Graduate Training:Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training.Licensure: For positions involving patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States. Applications will be accepted from physicians who are not currently licensed; however, if selected for appointment, they must (a) obtain a license before entering on duty, or (b) meet one of the following provisions:Waiver of Licensure Requirement: An agency may waive the licensure requirement for positions not involving direct patient care, e.g., positions performing disability evaluations, positions performing solely research, or administrative program managers. If the agency does not waive the license requirement for these kinds of positions, candidates may be appointed subject to obtaining a license within 1 year.Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board). Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license.Applicants who meet the basic requirements qualify for GS-11 positions.Additional Requirements for Grades GS-12 and Above:The requirements below are grouped according to types of programs-clinical and training, aviation medical, occupational health, disability evaluation, maternal and child health, and research.Clinical and Training Programs- Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. General practitioners must be skilled in recognizing various medical pathologies that require referral to specialists for diagnostic and treatment procedures. Graduate training and experience must, therefore, be well rounded. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled. Experience may not be substituted for training essential for performing specialized duties. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.General Practice positions:For GS-14 and above -- In addition to the requirements for GS-13, 1 year of appropriate experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade level.Specialist positions For GS-14 -- 4 years of residency training in the specialty of the position to be filled or equivalent experience and training.

[A Doctor of Medicine or equivalent degree from a foreign medical school that provided education and medical knowledge substantially equivalent to accredited schools in the United States may be demonstrated by permanent certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) (or a fifth pathway certificate for Americans who completed premedical education in the United States and graduate education in a foreign country).]In addition, to the Basic Requirements, you must also meet the Minimum Qualifications stated below-
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:
Graduate Training:Subsequent to obtaining a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy degree, a candidate must have had at least 1 year of supervised experience providing direct service in a clinical setting, i.e., a 1-year internship or the first year of a residency program in an institution accredited for such training. (This 1 year of supervised experience may be waived for research or administrative positions not requiring direct patient care.) For purposes of this standard, graduate training programs include only those internship, residency, and fellowship programs that are approved by accrediting bodies recognized within the United States or Canada. Listings of accredited programs are published yearly in the Directory of Residency Training Programs and the Yearbook and Directory of Osteopathic Physicians.An internship program involves broadly based clinical practice in which physicians acquire experience in treating a variety of medical problems under supervision (e.g., internal medicine, surgery, general practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics). Such programs are in hospitals or other institutions accredited for internship training by a recognized body of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA).A residency program involves training in a specialized field of medicine in an institution accredited for training in the specialty by a recognized body of the American Medical Association (AMA) or AOA.A fellowship program involves advanced training (beyond residency training) in a given medical specialty in either a clinical or research setting in a hospital or other institution accredited in the United States for such training.Licensure: For positions involving patient care, candidates must have a permanent, full, and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a State, District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States. Applications will be accepted from physicians who are not currently licensed; however, if selected for appointment, they must (a) obtain a license before entering on duty, or (b) meet one of the following provisions:Waiver of Licensure Requirement: An agency may waive the licensure requirement for positions not involving direct patient care, e.g., positions performing disability evaluations, positions performing solely research, or administrative program managers. If the agency does not waive the license requirement for these kinds of positions, candidates may be appointed subject to obtaining a license within 1 year.Appointments Pending Meeting Licensure Requirement: Individual circumstances may warrant appointments pending meeting the licensure requirement (e.g., when a candidate has a temporary license to practice until the next regular session of the licensing board). Persons appointed pending licensure may not be retained beyond 1 year of appointment if they do not obtain the license.Applicants who meet the basic requirements qualify for GS-11 positions.Additional Requirements for Grades GS-12 and Above:The requirements below are grouped according to types of programs-clinical and training, aviation medical, occupational health, disability evaluation, maternal and child health, and research.Clinical and Training Programs- Within Federal clinical and training programs, a distinction is made between general practice and specialist positions. General practitioners must be skilled in recognizing various medical pathologies that require referral to specialists for diagnostic and treatment procedures. Graduate training and experience must, therefore, be well rounded. Specialist positions require graduate training and experience related to the specialty and subspecialty of the position to be filled. Experience may not be substituted for training essential for performing specialized duties. The length and content of residency programs depends upon the specialization and requirements of recognized accrediting American medical specialty boards. These boards are authorized to conduct examinations to determine the competence of physicians in the specialty, to issue certificates of qualification, to participate in evaluating the quality of residency programs, and to determine the requirements for certification.General Practice positions:For GS-13 -- 3 years of graduate training or equivalent experience and training. For GS-14 and above -- In addition to the requirements for GS-13, 1 year of appropriate experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade level.Specialist positions For GS-13 -- 3 years of residency training in the specialty of the position to be filled or equivalent experience and training. For GS-14 -- 4 years of residency training in the specialty of the position to be filled or equivalent experience and training. For GS-15 -- 5 years of residency training in the specialty of the position to be filled or equivalent experience and training.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/462717400
