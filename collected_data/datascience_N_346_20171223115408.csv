Current, Permanent Employees of North Florida/South Georgia (NF/SG VHS)
ONLY""INDIVIDUAL OCCUPATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: BASIC REQUIREMENTS: DEGREE: Major study
in an academic field related to the health sciences or allied sciences
appropriate to the work of the position.BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL GRADES: Applicants who meet the basic requirements
described in the individual occupational requirements listed above are fully
qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who
wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and
above) must also meet the requirements for educations and specialized
experience listed below, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.The individual occupational requirements
typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic
requirements of the occupations covered by this standard: 1.
Successful
completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or
university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field
of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in the individual
occupational requirements (IOR). Where
specific course requirements are not indicated in the IOR Requirements, the
number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the
amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot
be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major
field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have
been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the
field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses
that may be accepted as part of the program major. 2.
Appropriate
combination of education and experience that is typically specified in the
individual occupational requirements (IOR). The method generally requires that
an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in the IOR
for the applicable degree field, plus additional education and/or experience.
The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a
major field of study is the same as described in the IOR. The
quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to
demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities
required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally
acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study
with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and
related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that
involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses
would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to
perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore,
creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or
abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation. In addition
to the basic requirements for employment, the following specific grade criteria
must be met at each grade level in which you are applying. EDUCATION AND SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: GS-09: Specialized
Experience: Applicants must have one
(1) year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade,
GS-07, in the normal line of progression for the occupation in the
organization. Examples of
specialized experience may include assists with the development of grant
proposals and materials supporting grant application; screens and evaluates
candidates for clinical research studies and projects of limited complexity
using objective rating techniques to identify potential candidates for
participation in studies; manages implementation, control and reporting on
clinical and outcome of research tests and administers standard test to measure
and track indicators; etc. (NOTE:
SF-50 ""Notification of Personnel Action"" showing series, grade, and
step of current position. Do not submit an ""Award or Incentive""
SF-50 as it cannot be used to qualify for this position. REQUIRED) Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including
volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps,
AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic;
religions; spiritual; community; student; social). Volunteer work helps build critical
competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and
experience that translates directly to paid employment. You will receive credit for all qualifying
experience, including volunteer experience. OR Education: MUST have two (2) full years of progressively
higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree or master's or
equivalent graduate degree? Completion
of graduate level education, in addition to meeting the basic requirement, is
qualifying at grades GS-07 through GS-11, and GS-12 research positions if it
provides the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work. One (1) year of full-time graduate education
is considered to be the number of credit hours that the school attended has
determined to represent one (1) year of graduate study. Part-time graduate education is creditable in
accordance with its relationship to a year of full-time study at the school
attended. PLEASE SUBMIT A COPY OF UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS WITH YOUR
APPLICATION, IF USING EDUCATION TO QUALIFY. (REQUIRED) OR Combination of Education and
Experience: Do you possess a
combination of successfully completed graduate level and specialized experience
required for the grade level for which you are applying for? Only graduate
education in excess of the amount required for the next lower grade level may
be used to qualify applicants for positions at grades GS-09 and GS-11. (For example, GS-07 must possess one (1) year
of graduate-level education or superior academic achievement.) PLEASE SUBMIT A COPY OF UNOFFICIAL

(From the VA Handbook 5005)BASIC REQUIREMENTS: The basic requirements
for employment as a VHA psychologist are prescribed by: Public Law 96-151
codified in Title 38, U.S.C. &#167; 7402. To qualify for appointment, all applicants
for the position of psychologist in VHA must meet the following: Citizenship. Citizen of the United States. Education. Have a doctoral degree in psychology from a graduate program in psychology
accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA), the Psychological
Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS), or the Canadian Psychological
Association (CPA) at the time the program was completed. The specialty area of
the degree must be consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to
be employed. For the purpose of meeting this requirement, the term
""specialty area"" refers to the specific specialty areas recognized by
the accrediting body and not to specific job duties that might require special
skills. Currently, APA accredits doctoral programs in the specialty areas of
clinical psychology, counseling psychology, school psychology, or combinations
of two or more of those areas. PCSAS accredits doctoral programs in
psychological clinical science. CPA accredits doctoral programs in clinical
psychology, counseling psychology, clinical neuropsychology, and school
psychology. There are no job assignments in VHA that require the skills of a
school psychologist; therefore, an applicant with a degree in the specialty
area of school psychology is not eligible for appointment. Strictly for the
purpose of determining eligibility for appointment as a psychologist in VHA,
there is no distinction between the specialty areas (with the exception of
school psychology). OR (2) Have a doctoral degree in any area of psychology and, in addition,
successfully complete a respecialization program (including documentation of an
approved internship completed as part of the respecialization program) meeting
both of the following conditions:
(a) the respecialization program must be completed in an APA or a CPA
accredited doctoral program; and (b) the specialty in which the applicant is retrained must be consistent with
the assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. NOTE: The applicant must provide an official transcript and/or
certificate documenting the completion of the respecialization program, which
includes completion of an APA or CPA internship. AND (3) Internships (a) Have successfully completed a professional psychology internship training
program that was accredited by APA or CPA at the time the program was completed
and that is consistent with the assignment for which the applicant is to be
employed. OR (b) New VHA psychology internship programs that are in the process of applying
for APA accreditation are acceptable in fulfillment of the internship
requirement, provided that such programs were sanctioned by the VHA Central
Office Program Director for Psychology and the VHA Office of Academic
Affiliations at the time that the individual was an intern; OR (c) VHA facilities that offered full-time, one-year pre-doctoral internships
prior to PL 96-151 (pre-1979) are considered to be acceptable in fulfillment of
the internship requirement; OR (d) Applicants who completed an internship that was not accredited by APA or
CPA at the time the program was completed may be considered eligible for hire
only if they are currently board certified by the American Board of
Professional Psychology in a specialty area that is consistent with the
assignment for which the applicant is to be employed. (NOTE: Once board
certified, the employee is required to maintain board certification.) Licensure. Hold a full, current, and unrestricted license to practice psychology at
the doctoral level in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States,
or the District of Columbia. Exception. Non-licensed applicants who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements
may be given a temporary appointment as a ""graduate psychologist"" at
the GS-11 or GS-12 grade under the authority of 38 U.S.C. &#167; 7405 (a)(1)(D) for
a period not to exceed two years from the date of employment on the condition
that such a psychologist provide care only under the supervision of a
psychologist who is licensed. Failure to obtain licensure during that period is
justification for termination of the temporary appointment. Proficient in the

paid or non-paid employment providing psychological work or through
participating in a supervised postdoctoral psychology training program (i.e.,
fellowship or residency). Psychological work experience must have occurred
after the doctoral degree was obtained and must have required the use of
knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics associated with current
professional psychology practice. ""Professional psychology practice""
includes but is not limited to the following psychology-oriented job duties:
providing professional clinical services, conducting research, carrying out
education and training activities, carrying out program evaluation activities,
clinical consultation, supervision and administration. (2) Quality of Experience. Experience is only creditable if it is
post-doctoral experience as a professional psychologist directly related to the
duties to be performed. Qualifying experience must also be at a level comparable
to or exceeding professional psychology experience at the next lower level. (3) Part-time Experience. Part-time experience is creditable according
to its relationship to a full-time workweek. For example, a psychologist
employed 20 hours per week, or on a &#189; time basis, would receive 1 full-time
workweek of credit for each 2 weeks of service. (4) Post-Doctoral Degree Fellowships. Postdoctoral fellowships or
residencies are training programs in an advanced area of clinical practice.
Training as a fellow or resident is considered to be creditable experience on a
year-for-year basis. GS-11 Staff Psychologist (Entry Level) EXPERIENCE None beyond the
basic requirements. GS-12 Staff Psychologist (Developmental Level) EXPERIENCE : At least 1 year of experience as a professional psychologist equivalent to
