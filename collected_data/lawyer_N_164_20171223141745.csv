If the Nature of Cases or Legal Problems identified does not fully satisfy the requirements indicated for a particular Type-level, they are credited at the next lower Type-level because each Type-level is described in terms of the minimum characteristics of the range of difficulty they represent. The level of practice for this position fully meets Type II criteria. The Joint Force Headquarters - State, Staff Judge Advocate General&#39;s office is the primary office of responsibility for legal and administrative concerns that arise from existing Federal and state/territory statute, regulatory guidance and prevailing precedent; policy and guidance development for new and emerging missions and programs lacking definitive programming or procedural guidance from Federal (Department of Defense, Department of Army, Department of Air Force, ARNG, ANG, etc), state/territory or other controlling agencies, often requiring extensive research and understanding of legislative or executive branch intent to effectively act or advise upon. Frequently issues have conflicting intent, ambiguous or absent guidance between Federal and state/territory, state/territory and state/territory, state/territory and local, DoD Component (Departments of Army and Air Force, or ARNG and ANG), and other agencies (Department of Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency), and/or Federal or state/territory executive branch issuances, etc. The incumbent functions as an expert, advising and acting across the full spectrum law concerns, including the highly conflicted and emotionally charged areas of trial or trial defense, equal opportunity and labor law provisions, processes and third party reviews, as well as personnel administrative actions. He/she provides review of, advice on and act upon difficult property, contract, procurement and special issues. He/she serves as the Adjutant General&#39;s representative on personnel administration and labor issues, i.e. employee grievances, disciplinary &amp; adverse actions, discrimination complaints, unfair labor practices and labor contract negotiations. Cases that arise require preparation for third party resolution or appellate review by arbitrators, administrative law judges, the Merit System Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission processes. Issues generally are strongly contested in either informal negotiations or formal hearings by the individuals, management representatives or unions representatives involved and have decisions with impact for wide application across organizations and potentially agency wide. The incumbent addresses legal issues that encompass environmental concerns associated with Federal and state/territory statutes; implementing regulations and directives; executive orders; and agency directives. These laws include, but are not limited to, air quality; water quality; wetlands and wildlife habitat; solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal; recreational uses of land; and historic preservations. Any of these have potential to adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the National Guard economically, socially or politically across a wide spectrum that ranges from statewide/territory-wide public support, to sovereign entities within the United States, with other sovereign states/territories, or neighboring nations. Advice rendered or resolutions sought directly or indirectly on contractual obligations involve large sums of money. While it is common to advise on, negotiate or review contracts for ""very large sums of money"", involved with military construction projects, environmental projects and cleanup, and subsequent cooperative or inter-service support agreements, it is less common for those ""very large sums of money"" to ""contested"", but those situations do exist. More common is the competition among individuals and companies for these contracting opportunities, and thus contract awards challenges as well as increasing willingness to formally challenge the means and methods to achieve contract specifications, thus delaying and adding additional administrative and inflationary costs to already expensive projects. These costs can, and do, soar achieving ""large"", and in some cases ""very large"", sums of money when the costs associated with the delays, studies and alternative processes are complied. Type II Factor Level is awarded.",https://www.usajobs.gov:443/GetJob/ViewDetails/486129500

FAILURE TO FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS WITHIN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFY YOU FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now interviewing and extending offers to first-year (1L) law students for its 2018 Summer Honors Program in Washington, DC. Though these are volunteer positions, they offer students responsibilities and experiences that promote their careers. Students work with Commission staff on projects particular to the Division or Office to which they are assigned. Students participate in seminars/workshops on various aspects of the federal securities laws. We ask that our students commit 40-hours per week for at least 10 weeks. We have high expectations for our students, often assigning them the same work we would give a newly-hired staff attorney. Students assist with tasks such as drafting regulations, reviewing filings, or preparing for interviews and testimony. They spend hours every day with line attorneys and they support senior executives. The Summer Honors Program is highly-competitive. We hire very few of the students who apply, and we limit the size of the program so that students receive substantive work. 1L students from past programs have gone on to work their second summer at law firms. Many pursue jobs that relate to securities, finance or related industries, but others have pursued other specialties while still using the skills that they learned at the SEC.
